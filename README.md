### About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer currently serving as the backend engineer at Engineering SPA since May 2021. 

Certified as an AWS Cloud Solutions Architect and Java Backend Engineer by JetBrains, I thrive in remote work environments and am open to exciting projects. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniopiga/) for professional inquiries.

Beyond the realm of coding, I hold a degree in philosophy and literature. When I'm not crafting code, you can find me immersed in a game of chess or trekking through the mountains, finding inspiration in nature's beauty. I'm also an aspiring sommelier with a passion for wine.

### Coding Passion

Coding isn't just a profession for me; it's a passion. I particularly enjoy coding games and challenging myself on platforms like CodeWars, where I proudly hold a blue belt. ü•ã Feel free to challenge me or discuss anything related to coding and gaming!
