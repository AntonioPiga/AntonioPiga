### About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer who began my journey in May 2021 when I started my first project at BE Digitech (Engineering SPA). Nowadays, I work as tech lead for Step4Business and Azimut Marketplace, and as Solutions Architect and Developer for Nuvolaris Inc

Certified as an AWS Cloud Solutions Architect from 2023 and Java Backend Engineer by JetBrains, I thrive in remote work environments and am open to exciting projects. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniopiga/) for professional inquiries.

Beyond the realm of coding, I hold a degree in philosophy and literature. When I'm not crafting code, you can find me immersed in a game of chess or trekking through the mountains, finding inspiration in nature's beauty. I'm also an aspiring sommelier with a passion for wine.

### Projects

I've tackled various projects throughout my career, including various projects at Engineering SPA (Nexi, Cotral, Azimut), backend development for Step4Business and Solution Architect for Nuvolaris. My commitment to quality and efficiency ensures successful project delivery and client satisfaction.

### Coding Passion

Coding isn't just a profession for me: it's a passion.

I particularly enjoy coding games and challenging myself on platforms like CodeWars, where I proudly hold a blue belt. ü•ã Feel free to challenge me or discuss anything related to coding and gaming!
